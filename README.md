VPN Setup and Privacy Analysis

##  Objective
To demonstrate how a VPN (Virtual Private Network) enhances online privacy and security by encrypting traffic and masking the user's real IP address.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used

- **VPN Client:** ProtonVPN (Free Plan)
- **Browser:** Google Chrome
- **IP Lookup:** [https://whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com)

##  Steps Performed

1. Installed ProtonVPN on my system and signed in.
2. Took a screenshot of my original connection state with actual IP:
   - **IP Address:** `157.46.2.145`
   - **Location:** India
   - **ISP:** Jio

3. Connected to the **Fastest Free Server** which selected **Japan (Tokyo)**.
   - **New IP Address:** `149.88.103.35`
   - **VPN Status:** Protected (WireGuard protocol)

4. Verified IP change and location using [whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com).

5. Confirmed that all internet traffic was routed securely through the VPN tunnel.

##  What I Learned

- A VPN encrypts all traffic between my device and the VPN server.
- My **real IP address is hidden**, and websites only see the VPN's IP.
- VPNs are crucial for **privacy on public Wi-Fi**, bypassing **geo-restrictions**, and **preventing ISP tracking**.
- ProtonVPN (free) offers decent speed and good privacy without logs.

##  VPN Benefits vs Limitations

|  Benefits                        | Limitations                          |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Hides real IP                    | Slower than normal connection        |
| Encrypts web traffic             | Limited server options on free plan  |
| Protects privacy on public Wi-Fi | Not a full anonymity tool            |
| Blocks trackers and ads          | May not work with all streaming sites|
